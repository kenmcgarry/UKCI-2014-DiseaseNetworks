Recently there has been a lot of interest in using
computational techniques to build networks of protein-to-protein
interactions, interacting gene networks and metabolic reactions.
Many interesting and novel discoveries have been made using
graph based structures using links and nodes to represent the
relationships between proteins and genes. Analysis of graph
networks has revealed that genes and proteins cooperate in
modules performing specific functions and that there is crosstalk
or overlap between modules. In this paper we take these ideas
further and build upon current knowledge to build up a network
of human related diseases based on graph theory and the concept
of overlap or shared function. We explore the hypothesis that
many human diseases are linked by common genetic modules,
therefore a defect in one of any of the cooperating genes in a
module may lead to a specific disease or related symptom. We
build our networks using data and information extracted from
several online databases along with supporting knowledge in the
form of biological ontologies.
